A SOC Engineer lab must generate real logs.

Required sources

Windows Server (Active Directory)

Auth logs, Kerberos, account changes

Windows Endpoints (1–2)

Process creation, PowerShell, registry, login events

Linux Server

Syslog, SSH, sudo, cron

Network telemetry

Firewall logs or VPC flow logs

Cloud telemetry (at least one)

AWS CloudTrail or Azure Activity Logs

If there’s no real telemetry → it’s not a SOC lab.

2️⃣ Log Collection & Pipelines (SOC engineer core skill)

You must build ingestion, not just “turn it on”.

Must include

Agents (Elastic Agent / Universal Forwarder)

Syslog forwarding

Cloud log ingestion

Field normalization

Timestamp correction

Noise filtering

SOC engineers are judged on pipeline quality:

Are fields parsed correctly?

Are useless logs filtered?

Is enrichment applied?

3️⃣ Central SIEM (the brain)

You need one real SIEM:

Elastic

Splunk

Microsoft Sentinel

Must be configured by you

Indexes / data streams

Data sources

Role-based access

Dashboards

If you didn’t configure ingestion → not SOC engineering.

4️⃣ Detection Engineering (this is the line)

This is what separates analysts from engineers.

You must build:

Custom detection rules

Threshold logic

Correlation rules (multi-event)

Risk scoring

Severity logic

Examples that must exist

Brute force → success correlation

Impossible travel

Suspicious PowerShell

Privilege escalation

Cloud IAM abuse

Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

If you’re writing detections → you’re doing SOC engineering.

5️⃣ Enrichment Layer (engineer mindset)

A working SOC lab enriches alerts automatically.

Required enrichments

GeoIP

User context

Host context

Asset criticality

Reputation (simulated or static lists)

Alerts without context = junior SOC.

6️⃣ Alert Lifecycle & Case Management

A SOC Engineer lab must show end-to-end flow.

Must include

Alert → case creation

Status tracking

Analyst notes

Evidence attachment

Closure logic

Even if ticketing is simulated — the workflow must exist.

7️⃣ Response & Automation (minimum viable SOAR)

You don’t need full SOAR — but you must automate something.

Examples

Auto-disable user (simulated)

Auto-isolate endpoint (simulated)

Auto-block IP

Auto-close benign alerts

This proves you understand response enablement, not just alerts.

8️⃣ Adversary Simulation (proof it works)

You must trigger your own detections.

Tools

Atomic Red Team

Manual attacks (PowerShell, failed logins)

Credential misuse

Lateral movement simulation

If detections never fire → lab is incomplete.

9️⃣ Dashboards (engineer-facing, not pretty)

Your dashboards should answer:

What’s firing most?

What’s noisy?

What’s high risk?

What’s broken?

SOC engineers build dashboards for analysts, not executives.

10️⃣ Documentation (required)

A real SOC Engineer lab includes:

Architecture diagram

Data flow diagram

Detection logic explanation

Known limitations
